## !! WARNING: READ THIS BEFORE USING THIS ADDON !!

Current `Default-scales` were quickly put together using `SimulationCraft` and `Excel` and **they probably aren't anywhere near the right weights**. SimulationCraft doesn't support healers, and at the time of simulations, Protection Warriors and for some reason I didn't get any usable results for Guardian Druids `Default Defensive -scales`.

If you have good source for ranking Azerite powers for your own spec, you make and export the best Custom-scale for your spec yourself, or you can help me improve my SimulationCraft templates, don't hesitate to contact me via PM, comment or ticket so I can improve the `Default-scales`.

This addon adds score markers on the Azerite powers on your Azerite gear to help you pick the best powers for your class and spec and tells you not only your current total score, but also the current and maximum score potential for the item. You can use built in `Default-scales`, make `New` scales for any class and spec or share them with others using `Export`/`Import`.
