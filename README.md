Helps you pick the best Azerite powers on your gear for your class and spec.

## !! WARNING: READ THIS BEFORE USING THIS ADDON !!

Current `Default-scales` were quickly put together using `SimulationCraft` and `Excel` and **they probably aren't anywhere near the right weights**. SimulationCraft doesn't support healers and, at the time of simulations, Protection Warriors and for some reason I didn't get any usable results for Guardian Druids `Default Defensive -scales`.

If you have good source for ranking Azerite powers for your own spec, you make and export the best Custom-scale for your spec yourself, or you can help me improve my SimulationCraft templates, don't hesitate to contact me via PM, comment or ticket so I can improve the `Default-scales`.

This addon adds score markers on the Azerite powers on your Azerite gear to help you pick the best powers for your class and spec and tells you not only your current total score, but also the current and maximum score potential for the item. You can use built in `Default-scales`, make `New` scales for any class and spec or share them with others using `Export`/`Import`.

Only one scale can be active to be showing scores in the Azerite UI at any given time, but you can check as many scales you want to be shown on tooltips in the Weights Editor. Tooltips will list those scales with current score, current potential and maximum score for the item you hover on.

If you are looking for role specific Azerite trait, but can't find it in the Weight Editor, the trait could be aimed for different role than you current (even though it could be usable by your class because you have access to specialization with that role). To make it appear in the Weight Editor, make sure `Show Role specific powers only for my own specialization role` is disabled in the Config (`ESC - Interface - AddOns - AzeritePowerWeights`)

If you are looking for specialization specific traits and it isn't there, it might be aimed for different specialization, but usable also by your current specialization. I'm working on getting these sorted out and added to the Weight Editor, but meanwhile you'll have to `Export` the scale, add the weight by hand and `Import` the string to update the scale.
